INTRODUCTION
------------

I based this off "Views Responsive Grid" 
https://drupal.org/project/views_responsive_grid

Trying to make a views plugin that lists items vertically or
horizontally into any number of columns that the user chooses.


INSTALLATION
------------

1. Download module and copy views_listhv folder to sites/all/modules

2. Enable Views and Views Views Lists - Horizontally or Vertically modules.


HOW TO USE
------------

After enabling the module, create a new view with the view list display
format. Specify the number of columns, and the alignment.
